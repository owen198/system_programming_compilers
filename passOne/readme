#Implementation and representation of symbol table used in assembler.(Partial Pass-1)
ASSEMBLER
Assembler is a program for converting instructions written in low-level assembly code into relocatable machine code and generating along information for the loader.
It generates instructions by evaluating the mnemonics (symbols) in operation field and find the value of symbol and literals to produce machine code. Now, if assembler do all this work in one scan then it is called single pass assembler, otherwise if it does in multiple scans then called multiple pass assembler. Here assembler divide these tasks in two passes:
•	Pass-1:
1.	Define symbols and literals and remember them in symbol table and literal table respectively.
2.	Keep track of location counter
3.	Process pseudo-operations
•	Pass-2:
1.	Generate object code by converting symbolic op-code into respective numeric op-code
2.	Generate data for literals and look for values of symbols

Working of Pass-1: 
Define Symbol and literal table with their addresses.
Note: Literal address is specified by LTORG or END.
